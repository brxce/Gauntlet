- !playermode <number of players> allows for instant adjustment between 1-8(cvar'able) survivor slots. Adjusts common cvars and other cvars to adapt to the survivor limit
- please make players aware of this new command ^
- New spawning plugin allows for more varied spawns. Each SI class still respects a limit, but there is also a wave size limit that restricts the total number of SI spawned at a time.
Set plural limits for each SI class to allow for varied spawns. For example, with a limit of 2 for each of the six SI classes but a group spawn size of 3, there is an equal possibility for each of the classes to be included in one of the three slots, and even a chance for double a particular class to spawn.
- new SpawnPositioner module teleports SI closer to survivors upon spawn, making non-hunter SI more threatening when spawned in a decently sized wave.
	- !spawnmode 0(vanilla) recommended for closed maps like Parish and !spawnmode 2(grid) recommended over !spawnmode 1(radial) for open maps like dark carnival
- SI(besides tank) now die of LOS starvation after 10 seconds. This helps clear out SI that have spawned in bad places, especially in finales, and blocking further SI from spawning. 

SPECIALSPAWNER.SMX
With 'special' ;) thanks to the authors of the l4d2_autoIS plugin, all credits to them for their code:
- Compatible with survival; launch a survival game from lobby, then load "Gauntlet Survival" config (vanilla weapons and equipment)
- New plugin [specialspawner.smx] to replace [special_infected_wave_spawner.smx]
	- SI spawn in groups of configurable size, up to an 'SI limit'
	- 'SI limit' cvar that can be overriden with Admin only 'SI limit Server cap' cvar 
	- SI class limits and spawn weights that affect spawn probability; spawns will vary a lot more 
	- !limit, !weight, !timer cmds for all users
	- hold your "USE" and "RELOAD" keys to read limits and other customisation settings off the Spawner HUD; fades after 1s
- SI can now spawn within LOS of survivors
Created two new spawn modes that may be accessed with the 'spawnmode'
command
0:  vanilla spawning from far away
1: RADIAL spawning (spawn on the circumference of circles of radius cvar
'ss_spawn_proximity_min'
2: GRID spawning
- grid encompasses highest and lowest 'x' and 'y' coordinates held by
survivor team
- SI spawn spawn within buffer zone of distance 'ss_spawn_proximity_max'
around the survivor grid
- spawn coordinates are generated using uniform RNG
Both RADIAL and GRID spawning fallback onto vanilla spawning if
'ss_spawn_search_attempt_limit' is reached

SM_GIVE_GIVEMENU.SMX
- added !give plugin that alllows survivors to pick their weapon

COOPBOSSES.SMX
- Added witch spawning functionality to coopbosses
	- see sourcecode for cvars

AI_HARDSI.SMX
- fixed smoker death while smoking dmg threshold dropping to 50
- jockeys now respect the "z_jockey_leap_again_timer" cooldown on their ability

AUTOSLAYER.SMX now has a new(default) mode that slays after a configured amount time all SI if all survivors are immobilised

Added PLAYERMODE.SMX
- use command !playermode to add or remove survivors between 1 and 'pm_max_survivors' cvar
- any playermode above 4 uses four player cvars except for 'survivor_limit'

TICKRATEFIXES.SMX
- removed l4dpistoldelay.smx load as it is superceded by TickrateFixes
- removed duplicate plugin loads

Added new vanilla cvar settings to improve AI thanks to this addon: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=732341797
Not sure what they all do, but I have selected these as they sound like they have potential for improved AI. 2147483647 appears to be the largest number possible for a cvar
